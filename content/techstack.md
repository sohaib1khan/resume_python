## 🚀 **GitOps: Infrastructure Automation with Git**

> *"Declarative, automated, and version-controlled deployments."*

**GitOps** is a modern infrastructure management approach that leverages **Git as the single source of truth** for defining and deploying applications and infrastructure. This methodology enables seamless, automated, and consistent deployments while maintaining high visibility and control.

### 🔹 **Key Principles of GitOps**

✅ **Declarative Configuration** – Define infrastructure and application states in code.  
✅ **Version Control as Source of Truth** – Store all configurations in **Git repositories** for tracking changes.  
✅ **Automated Deployments** – CI/CD pipelines continuously sync deployments to match the defined state.  
✅ **Observability & Auditing** – Every change is logged and versioned for full visibility.

### 🛠️ **GitOps Tools in My Stack**

🔹 **ArgoCD** – A declarative **GitOps continuous delivery** tool designed for **Kubernetes**.  
🔹 **Jenkins** – Automates CI/CD pipelines, integrating GitOps workflows for deployments.  
🔹 **FluxCD** – Kubernetes-native GitOps tool for managing clusters and workloads.  
🔹 **Helm** – **Package manager** for Kubernetes, used alongside GitOps to simplify deployments.

📜 [GitOps Learning Repository](https://github.com/sohaib1khan/GitOps_Projects) – A sandbox for practicing GitOps workflows with ArgoCD and Jenkins.

### ⚡ **GitOps in Action**

- 📌 **Automating Kubernetes Deployments** – ArgoCD watches Git repositories and ensures cluster state matches committed configurations.
- 🔄 **CI/CD Integration** – Jenkins triggers pipeline execution when Git updates occur.
- 🔎 **Secure & Scalable Deployments** – Helm charts and manifests define applications while Git history provides audit logs.

* * *

### 🔥 **Why GitOps?**

🔹 **Improved Deployment Speed & Reliability** – No manual configurations, reducing errors.  
🔹 **Easy Rollbacks** – Revert to previous Git commits instantly if something breaks.  
🔹 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Alignment** – Works alongside Terraform & Ansible.  
🔹 **Scalability** – Ideal for managing multi-cluster environments.
